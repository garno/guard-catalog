# guard-catalog
*[Catalog](https://github.com/garno/catalog) prevents your folders from becoming a mess.*

# Installation

Before beginning, you'll need [guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) installed on your system.

```
gem install guard
```

Once completed, install `guard-catalog` :

```
gem install guard-catalog
```

Finally, generate a `Guardfile` in the folder you want to *catalog*:

```
guard init catalog
```

# Usage

This can't be use as of today, I need to complete the [catalog](https://github.com/garno/catalog) CLI before.
Stay tuned :)
